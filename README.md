Implementation Plan for RBAC Assignment
Step 1: Project Setup
Choose a Tech Stack
Decide on the programming language, framework, and database you want to use.

Backend Framework: Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, or Spring Boot.
Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or any preferred DB.
Frontend (Optional): React, Angular, or a simple HTML form for user interaction.
Initialize the Project

Create the project folder and initialize it (e.g., npm init, django-admin startproject, etc.).
Set up version control with Git and create a repository on GitHub.
Install dependencies:
Authentication libraries (jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, or equivalents in your stack).
Framework-specific middleware for request handling and security.
Step 2: Authentication System
User Registration

Create a user model with fields such as id, username, email, password, and role.
Ensure the password is hashed using a secure method like bcrypt before saving to the database.
User Login

Validate user credentials.
Generate a secure token (e.g., JWT) upon successful login. Store user roles and permissions in the payload.
Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms.
User Logout

Invalidate the token on the client-side (optional: implement server-side token blacklisting).
Step 3: Authorization and RBAC
Role and Permission Definitions

Define roles (Admin, User, Moderator, etc.) and associate specific permissions with each role (e.g., CRUD operations, endpoint access).
Role Assignment

Assign roles to users during or after registration.
Store role data in the database or a configuration file.
Middleware for RBAC

Create middleware to check:
If the user is authenticated (e.g., a valid JWT token).
If the user has the required role/permission for the requested action.
Step 4: Secure Endpoints
Create endpoints for different functionalities (e.g., /admin, /user/profile, /moderator/review).
Use RBAC middleware to restrict access based on user roles.
Step 5: Test and Document
Testing

Write unit and integration tests for authentication and RBAC features.
Use tools like Postman or curl to manually test API endpoints.
Documentation

Create a README.md file detailing:
Project overview.
Features and functionality.
Installation and usage instructions.
How to test the system.
Bonus Features (Optional)
OAuth Implementation
Add OAuth-based login (Google, GitHub, etc.) for a more robust authentication mechanism.

Advanced Permissions
Implement granular permissions, allowing fine-tuned access control within roles.

User Management Dashboard
Build an admin interface for managing users, roles, and permissions.

Activity Logs
Track user activities and store logs for audit purposes.
